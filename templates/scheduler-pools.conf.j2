# Configures the thread pools of the Mule Runtime
#
# Certain attributes support expressions. Those are arithmetic expressions (+, -, / or * operators supported only) or
# functions (max(a, b), min(a, b)) that are evaluated when the runtime starts.
# Those expressions may be applied to numbers (integers or decimals) or any of the following variables:
# * cores: the number of processors available to the Java virtual machine.
# * mem: the maximum amount of memory that the Java virtual machine will attempt to use, in kilobytes.

# The maximum time (in milliseconds) to wait until all tasks in all the runtime thread pools have completed execution when
# stopping the scheduler service.
